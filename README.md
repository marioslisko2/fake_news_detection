# fake_news_detection

This project was made as a part of my master's thesis. Its written in croatian. This is the abstract translated to english.
<p>
The topic of this master's thesis is the application of algorithms for automatic detection of fake news. The thesis consists of a theoretical part, which describes the problem of the spread of fake news, provides an overview of other papers dealing with a similar topic, and describes the tools and algorithms that will be used in the thesis. The second part of the thesis refers to an experiment in which the process of developing a model for detecting fake news is described. The data sets that will be used are described, all the data preparation methods used and then the machine learning algorithms used are shown. At the end of the work, the obtained results are presented, they are compared with the results from other papers, and a conclusion is drawn. 

Keywords: <em> Disinformation, fake news, labelled dataset, natural language processing, machine learning algorithms, accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix </em>
